# Portfolio

## Description
This is the first draft of my portfolio, made using my css skills and knowledge. As I work on projects I can add to it but for now it has my contact information, a brief blurb about myself, and placeholders for future projects. I pulled in my knowledge about flex box, parent and child elements, containers, and other css stylings to build this page in a way that it fulfills the requirements of the challenge but also incorporates my own style. I will go back and make changes to be more professional but the fun of CSS is experimenting with it.
